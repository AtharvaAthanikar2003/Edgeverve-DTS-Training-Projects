# Literals - values -> numbers, characters, boolean, objects (class), arrays

# Datatypes - 
## Primitives - Pre-defined datatypes
### numbers - to store no.s only 1 datatype - number, double precision 64 bit format
## Non-Primitives - User-defined datatypes
## e.g.: first class citizen (fcc) - functions (function is treated as value/object in JS)

# null datatype is used to set value of object which is not known (used in empty values)
## eg- student id, name is known but course may not be known (variable is declared but value is not there)

# undefined (by default datatype supported by js) - if any value of variable is not defined, the value set by default is undefined (used in unassigned values, variable is declared but if null is not given, it gets undefined)

# scope- block, function, global

# var - can reassign and redeclare
# let - can reassign, not redeclare
# const - cannot reassign or redeclare

# typeof - keyowrd in js which tells datatype of entered input
# operators - 
## unary - increment, decrement, logical not, bitwise not, typeof, delete, void

## ternary - ?:
