The component lifecycle in angular consist of 4 stages -
Creation: It's instantiated and its dependencies are injected
Change Detection: Angular checks for the changes in the data bound properties
Rendering: Components template is updated
Destruction: Component is destroyed

Lifecycle Hooks: 
1. ngOnChanges(): It's used to respond to the changes in input properties
2. ngOnInit(): It's used to initialize the component after angular displays the properties
3. ngDoCheck(): Detect and act upon the changes
4. ngAfterContentInit: Used to perform any additional initialization
5. ngAfterViewInit: Used to check whether changes are done or not
6. ngOnDestroy: Destroy the component and clean up the resources
